# Python Neural Network

This is a simple and straightforward implementation of a neural network in Python. You can think of it as a translation of 3Blue1Brown's 4-part series on neural networks into computer code.

Little effort was made towards optimization. There are a lot of libraries and projects out there for optimized machine learning. This project is all about the human learning of machine learning. The code is very straightforward, simple, organized, and as easy to understand as possible. Every operation is broken up into discrete methods with names that are easy to comprehend and inner workings that can be understood if examined.

Think of this as a companion to the 3Blue1Brown series. So, I highly recommend watching that first or watching it with this code open and seeing if you can follow what he is talking about in this code.

Anyway! Please enjoy and use this code in any way you see fit. No rules or attributions required.
