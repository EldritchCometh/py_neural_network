# Python Neural Network


## ðŸ‘‹ Description
This is a simple implementation of a neural network in Python. You can think of it as a translation of 3Blue1Brown's 4-part series on neural networks into computer code.

There are many libraries and projects out there for optimized machine learning. This project is about the human learning of machine learning. The code is straightforward and hopefully well organized. I attempted to make it as easy to follow and understand as possible. Every operation is broken up into discrete methods with descriptive names and inner workings that should be able to be understood if examined.

As a companion to the 3Blue1Brown series, I recommend watching that first or with this code open to see if you can follow along with his explanations in this code.

## ðŸš€ Use
Default funtionality, if you don't change anything in the code, is to run like this:

```nn = NeuralNetwork([784, 16, 16, 10])```<br>
```nn.train_network(1, 32, 5)```

This will:
  * Create a NeuralNetwork object with shape `[784, 16, 16, 10]`
  * Train it with learning rate 1 and batch size 32 for 5 minutes. 
  * Print a progress report on the console every 10 seconds and 
  * Print a final report at the end of the 5 minutes. 
    The reports are tested against the totally segrigated testing data set and include
      * accuracy of the predictions and
      * the mean squared error measurement of loss .

Try different network shapes by changing the shape peramater in the init method of the NeuralNetwork class.

Try out different learning rates, batch sizes, and training times as arguments in the train_network method.

Save and load models by supplying a name to the neural_network class on instantiation to load and a name as an additional paramater of the train_network method to save.

I included a script for how I formatted and packaged the raw mnist data. I recommend just using the provided pickle but the script is there if you want to prepare the data yourself.
