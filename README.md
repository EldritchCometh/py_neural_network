# Python Neural Network

This is a simple and straightforward implementation of a neural network in Python. You can think of it as a translation of 3Blue1Brown's 4-part series on neural networks into computer code.

There are many libraries and projects out there for optimized machine learning. This project is about the human learning of machine learning. The code is straightforward and hopefully well organized. I attempted to make it as easy to follow and understand as possible. Every operation is broken up into discrete methods with descriptive names and inner workings that should be able to be understood if examined.

As a companion to the 3Blue1Brown series, I recommend watching that first or with this code open to see if you can follow along with his explanations in this code.
